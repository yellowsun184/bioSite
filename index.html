        <h2>Getting to Know Him...</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            Today I sat down with Johnathan and asked him a few questions about himself. I wished to get to know my subject just a little better. I asked him first
            what are some of your personal goals? He stated "I believe one of my most important goals is to find a career that I enjoy that makes me enough money that I can spend time
            with the people I love without worry." Do you have any personal heroes or people you look to for inspiration? "That's a difficult one because there is so many influental
            people in this world. But if I had to give names."
        </p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Bill Gates</li>
            <li>Keanu Reeves</li>
            <li>Jimmy Buffet</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            That's an interesting choice of people, is their something in common they have that you look for? "They all have done some sort of Charity work even with the amunt of money
            they have obtained over the years." So would you say that one of your goals is work with charity? "Yes, I would like to make enough money that I could actually start
            my own for senior cats, you see so many stuck in shelters that I would love to give them final resting homes where they can be comfortable."
        </p>

        <p>
            Did you have many cats growing up that led you to feel this way? "I had a few elder cats that were my parents growing up, both in their late teens, though the cause
            did not hit me till way later. When I met Ricki the senior cat, my heart melted. Ricki showed me you didn't have to be a young cat to be adorable and loved."
            Do you mind me asking, what is your favorite hobby?
            <span class=sentence >"I love to travel, honestly it's one of my favorite things, especially with you."</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Do you have any goals related to travelling? " Oh yes, there are so many places to go and see. I would love to see a waterfall, that I can actually swim under, I have never had
            the chance unfortunately. I would also love to go to just a wide open valley somewhere green and have a picnic."
